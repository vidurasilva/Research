        We want Challenge Accepted to be a place where people respect the rights and feelings of
        others, including third party intellectual property rights. Therefore, we
        have established certain rules for using Challenge Accepted and for posting messages,
        photos, video and other content ("Content") on Challenge Accepted, which rules are set
        forth in the Terms of Use and in this Code of Conduct. WHEN YOU USE CHALLENGE ACCEPTED,
        YOU ARE AGREEING TO ABIDE BY THE CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE OTHER RULES SET
        FORTH IN OUR TERMS OF USE. FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THIS CODE OF CONDUCT AND

    </p>
    <h2>Third-Party Content</h2>
    <p>
        Challenge Accepted allows you to upload and share user generated Content with your
        friends, such as photographs and videos you upload from your camera, webcam
        or mobile phone. This means that you may post and share original
        photographs and video that are of a personal nature that: (i) are of you or
        others, (ii) are taken by you or others, or (iii) are original art or
        animation created by you or others. It is not intended as a place for you
        to post third-party copyrighted content. In addition, we expect our users
        to use good judgment and respect the copyrights and other intellectual
        property rights of others. Therefore, in using Challenge Accepted, you may not:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                upload or share any photographs, videos or other Content other than
                original works that are created by you or another user
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>

            </p>
        </li>

            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Inappropriate Content</h2>
    <p>
        While we believe users should be able to express themselves and their point
        of view, certain kinds of speech simply do not belong in a community like
        Challenge Accepted
    </p>
    <p>
        . Therefore, you may not post or share Content that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>

        Client from achieving the Goal. Client and Challenge Accepted agree that it is a basic
        assumption of the parties in making this contract that Client will bear the
        risk of any inability to achieve the Goals/Plans. Client understands that
        Client is solely responsible for the identification and description of the
        Goals/Plans as specified in the Goals/Plans Creation process and THAT
        CLIENT BEARS ALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH A GOAL/CREATION PROCESS,
        including, but not limited to, Client's efforts to satisfy the Goal and
        Client's ultimate Success or Failure in achieving the Goal. In addition,
        Client understands that Client is solely responsible for any loss, damage,
        illness, injury or death to person or loss or damage to property related in
        any way to the Goal or Client's efforts in connection with the Goal.

        2CHILDREN UNDER AGE 18
    </strong>
    <p>
        2.1 <u>Goals/plans may not be appropriate for children.</u> Children under
        age 13 are prohibited from creating Goals and CLIENT REPRESENTS AND
        WARRANTS THAT CLIENT IS NOT UNDER AGE 13. Challenge Accepted recommends that children age
        13 to 18 talk with their parents or guardians before creating a Goal.
        Individuals under age 18 are prohibited from creating Goals with Money
        Stakes.

    <strong>
        3SUPERVISOR
    </strong>
    <p>
        3.1<u>Applicability.</u> The terms of this paragraph 3 apply if and only if
        a Supervisor is designated in the Goal creation process.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.2<u>The Supervisor.</u> Client agrees that reports/emails/notifications
        from the Supervisor shall be binding as to (i) whether Client has
        adequately cooperated in the Supervisor's attempts to verify whether Client
        has kept the Goals/Plans and (ii) whether Client has failed to keep the
        Goals/Plans. Reports of Failure from either Client or the Supervisor will
        trigger the emails and charges described below in paragraphs 5 and 6.
        Client acknowledges that Challenge Accepted has not endorsed or warranted, and has no
        duty to verify, the accuracy of the Supervisor's reports. Client also
        acknowledges that Challenge Accepted does not verify the identity of anyone logging into
        the Supervisor's account and that Challenge Accepted will accept any reports from the
        Supervisor's account as being from the Supervisor. Client and Challenge Accepted agree
        that it is a basic assumption of the parties in making this contract that
        Client will bear the risk that the Supervisor reports to Challenge Accepted might be
        inaccurate.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.3
        <u>
            Relationship between Supervisor and parties to the Goals/Plans
            Contract.
        </u>
        The Supervisor is not a party to this contract. Client and Supervisor may
        agree to any procedure to be followed so that Supervisor may verify
        Client's progress towards his or her Goals/Plans. Client agrees to
        cooperate with Supervisor to conduct any agreed verification procedure for
        Client's goals/plans. Client agrees that the Supervisor has sole discretion
        to determine whether Client has adequately cooperated. Client is free to
        enter into contracts with the Supervisor under which Client may compensate
        the Supervisor or a third-party for any verification procedure. Under no
        circumstances will Challenge Accepted be obligated under this Agreement to compensate the
        Supervisor or a third-party for any verification procedure or agreement
        entered into between the Client and the Supervisor.
    </p>
    <strong>
        4REPORTS
    </strong>
    <p>
        4.1<u> Reports and Photo Checkins.</u> Client promises that he or she will
        make all required reports/photos &#8211; including but not limited to
        photos via photo checkins - to Client's account/app at the Website/app by
        the required date or dates. Client acknowledges that there exist
        circumstances within or beyond Client's control that may prevent Client
        from making a required Report/Photo Check-in in a timely manner. These
        circumstances include (but are not limited to) the possibility that Client
        will not have access to the Internet. If Challenge Accepted permits late filing of a
        report/photo check-in, Client agrees to follow any rules Challenge Accepted adopts
        regarding such late filing. Client and Challenge Accepted agree that it is a basic
        assumption of the parties in making this contract that Client will bear the
        risk of any inability to report.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.2<u>Failure.</u> Client shall be deemed to have failed in a reporting
        period (a "Failure") if, subject to any extension procedure Challenge Accepted adopts in
        accordance with paragraph 4.1: (a) Client reports that Client has failed to
        achieve the Goals/Plans; or (b) Supervisor reports that Client has failed
        to achieve the Goals/Plans for that reporting period (even if Client
        reports Success).
    </p>
    <p>
        4.3<u>Success.</u> Client shall be deemed to have succeeded in a reporting
        period (a "Success") if Client has not reported Failure, as defined in
        Paragraph 4.2.
    </p>
    <strong>
        5EMAILING THIRD PARTIES
    </strong>
    <p>
        5.1Client authorizes Challenge Accepted to send emails to the Supervisor reporting
        Client's Success or Failure in (i) making mandated Reports, and (ii)
        keeping the Goals/Plans. A Supervisor may opt out of receiving further
        emails.

        6TERMS FOR FINANCIAL GOALS/PLANS CONTRACTS
    </strong>
    <p>
        6.1
        <strong>
            Client understands that if, as described in the Goals/Plans, Client has
            elected an amount of money to be at risk in each reporting period in
            the event of Failure ("Goals/Plans Stakes") then such Goals/Plans
            Stakes are governed by this paragraph 6
        </strong>
        . Client further understands that Client is not entitled to any interest on
        any Goals/Plans Stakes held by Challenge Accepted pursuant to this paragraph 6.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.2<u>Client Representations.</u> Client represents that the total of all
        Goals/Plans Stakes authorized by Client is less than 10 percent of Client's
        annual income.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.3<u>Payment and Billing.</u> If the Goals/Plans has Money Stakes, then
        Client agrees to provide Challenge Accepted with certain information, including without
        limitation, Client's full name, address, telephone number, credit card
        information, and bank account information. Client agrees to provide Challenge Accepted
        with the foregoing information as well as any other mandatory information
        that is accurate, complete and current. Challenge Accepted will maintain such information
        in secure, encrypted form and in accordance with any applicable laws.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Client shall be responsible for all charges incurred as a result of
        Client's Goals/Plans, including any applicable taxes. If payment cannot be
        charged to Client's credit card or if a charge is refunded for any reason,
        including chargeback, Challenge Accepted reserves the right to immediately and without
        notice, either suspend or terminate Client's access and account, thereby
        terminating all of Challenge Accepted's obligations under this Agreement. Client is
        required to pay any amounts still owed to Challenge Accepted at the time Client's account
        is suspended or terminated.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.4<u>Payment Processing.</u> If the Goals/Plans has Goals/Plans Stakes,
        then Client authorizes Challenge Accepted to charge Client's credit card in one of two
        methods: (i) Pay-as-you go, and (ii) Prepayment.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.4.1<u>Pay-as-you go.</u> If Prepayment is not selected because that
        option is either not offered by Challenge Accepted or not selected by Client, then Client
        authorizes Challenge Accepted to charge Client's credit card only upon Failure; such
        charge shall equal the Goals/Plans Stakes for that reporting period
        ("Forfeited Stakes"). Client understands that such a charge could occur in
        each and every reporting period.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.4.2<u>Prepayment.</u> This paragraph governs the treatment of Client's
        Prepayment if one is specified in the Goals/Plans Creation process. The
        Prepayment is the amount that Client authorizes Challenge Accepted to charge Client's
        credit card to cover the Goals/Plans Stakes of multiple reporting periods
        at the time of entering into the Goals/Plans Contract. If Client reports
        Failure pursuant to paragraph 4, Challenge Accepted will deduct from the Client's
        Prepayment the Goals/Plans Stakes for that reporting period ("Deducted
        Stakes"). Client understands that such a deduction could occur in each and
        every reporting period.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Challenge Accepted may return any remaining portion of the Prepayment (without interest)
        to Client at the end of the contract. The Prepayment is owned by Challenge Accepted and
        Challenge Accepted has at most a contingent, non-fiduciary duty to transfer amounts to
        the Client or to Designated Recipients pursuant to paragraph 6.5. If Challenge Accepted
        deducts from the Client's Prepayment during the term of the Goals/Plans
        Contract, Client authorizes Challenge Accepted to charge Client's credit card or
        electronic payment system an amount sufficient to replenish the Prepayment
        to maintain a constant amount throughout the term of this Goals/Plans
        Contract. If for any reason Client is more than 2 weeks late in
        replenishing the Prepayment under this paragraph, Client authorizes Challenge Accepted to
        treat the remaining Prepayment as Deducted Stakes and agrees that the
        contractual obligations of both sides will come to an end. Client and Challenge Accepted
        agree that it is a basic assumption of the parties in making this contract
        that Client will bear the risk of any inability to replenish the funds in a
        timely manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.5<u>Transfers.</u> Client agrees that Challenge Accepted will transfer Forfeited Stakes
        and Deducted Stakes, less certain fees and transaction costs charged by
        Challenge Accepted, as described in paragraph 6.5.4, ("Transferrable Stakes") to the
        third party friend/foe, charity or negative charity, or other person or
        entity (including Challenge Accepted itself), as identified in the Goals/Plans creation
        process that Client has designated as the party or entity to receive a
        portion of the Client's Goals/Plans Stakes ("Designated Recipient"),
        provided that the Designated Recipient may not be the Client and Challenge Accepted may,
        in its sole discretion, cancel the Goals/Plans of Client if Challenge Accepted determines
        that the Designated Recipient is the Client. The parties intend that
        neither Challenge Accepted nor Client will take any charitable tax deduction for any
        contribution made to charity pursuant to this contract. Challenge Accepted has no
        liability to Client or any Designated Recipient for any shortfall in the
        amount of funds made available by Client to Challenge Accepted to pay the Designated
        Recipient. Under no circumstances is Challenge Accepted obligated to make transfers to
        third parties beyond the Transferrable Stakes.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.5.1<u>Transfers if the Designated Recipient is a Friend/Foe.</u> It is
        the responsibility of the Client or, if appropriate, the Designated
        Recipient to provide Challenge Accepted with the correct information for transmitting
        Transferrable Stakes to a Designated Recipient and Challenge Accepted shall have no
        obligation to verify such information. Challenge Accepted's only obligation shall be to
        attempt to transmit Transferrable Stakes in accordance with transmission
        information provided to Challenge Accepted by the Client or the Designated Recipient. If
        Challenge Accepted is unable, after good faith efforts, to transmit Transferrable Stakes
        to the Designated Recipient within a period of 90 days following the
        completion of the Agreement, the Client authorizes Challenge Accepted to contribute the
        Transferrable Stakes to a person or entity of Challenge Accepted's choosing, including
        Challenge Accepted itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.5.2
        <u>
            Transfers when the Designated Recipient is a charity or negative
            charity.
        </u>
        Challenge Accepted's only obligation shall be to attempt to transmit Transferrable Stakes
        in accordance with transmission information provided to Challenge Accepted by the
        Designated Recipient. If Challenge Accepted is unable, after good faith efforts, to
        transmit Transferrable Stakes to the Designated Recipient within a period
        of 90 days following the completion of the Agreement, the Client authorizes
        Challenge Accepted to contribute the Transferrable Stakes to a person or entity of Challenge Accepted's
        choosing, including Challenge Accepted itself. If a Designated Recipient is a negative
        charity and rejects the Transferrable Stakes (or Transferrable Stakes
        associated with another user's creation process), then Client authorizes
        Challenge Accepted to change the Designated Recipient to charity for reporting periods
        beginning after such rejection.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.5.3<u>Timing of transfer to Designated Recipient.</u> The actual
        distribution of Transferrable Stakes will occur, at Challenge Accepted's sole discretion,
        either periodically during the term of the Goals/Plans or upon such
        schedule as Challenge Accepted may adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.5.4<u>Fees.</u> In order to pay transaction costs and compensate Challenge Accepted for
        its services under this Agreement, Challenge Accepted charges the following Fees. Unless
        set forth otherwise in supplemental terms to this Goals/Plans Contract,
        Challenge Accepted's Fee, which is deducted from Forfeited Stakes and Deducted Stakes to
        calculate Transferrable Stakes, shall be: (a) for all Goals/Plans for which
        the Designated Recipient is a friend or foe; the greater of $1.00 or the
        transaction costs actually incurred by Challenge Accepted in such transactions; (b) for
        all Goals/Plans Contracts for which the Designated Recipient is an negative
        charity, 50% of all Forfeited Stakes and/or Deducted Stakes plus any
        electronic processing fees incurred by Challenge Accepted; and (c) for all other
        contracts, 20% of all Forfeited Stakes and/or Deducted Stakes plus any
        electronic processing fees incurred by Challenge Accepted. Challenge Accepted pays all transaction
        costs; the Fees do not represent any additional cost to the Client.

    </strong>
    <p>
        7.1<u>Client Representations</u>. Client represents that Client has not
        been diagnosed with an active condition of anorexia or bulimia nervosa,
        respiratory disease, heart condition or any other condition that would make
        the Goals/Plans unhealthful.
    </p>
    <p>
        7.2<u>Health Disclaimer.</u> Challenge Accepted is not a medical organization. Nothing
        contained in this contract or on the Website/app should be construed as
        medical advice. The information and goal-tracking reports generated by Challenge Accepted
        should not be interpreted as a substitute for physician consultation,
        evaluation, or treatment. Client acknowledges that Challenge Accepted has no knowledge of
        Client's health condition and that Client alone is responsible for whether
        the Goals/Plans poses any health or other risks to Client. Client is urged
        and advised to seek the advice of a physician before beginning any health
        or fitness contract. Health and fitness contracts are not intended for use
        by persons with an adverse health condition or who are pregnant. Pregnant

        contained herein, Challenge Accepted's liability to Client for any cause whatsoever, and
        regardless of the form of the action, in no case will exceed the lesser of
        Client's Goals/Plans Stakes for the specific Goals/Plans at issue or
        $1,000. Client acknowledges that if no fees are paid by client to Challenge Accepted for
        the service, Client shall be limited to injunctive relief only, unless

        authority to cancel any contract that Challenge Accepted, in its sole discretion, deems
        to be inappropriate, unhealthful, illegal, against public policy, or based
        on false information provided by the Client.

    <p>

        except in one circumstance: (1) Client cancels the Goals/Plans Contract

        to Challenge Accepted. The Client is responsible for providing a correct/working e-mail
        address. Challenge Accepted reserves the right to modify this Refund Policy at its
